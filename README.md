what's for dinner?

Our application helps indecisive people decide what to have for dinner, by choosing their dinner for them based on the answers that they input into our scientifically comprehensive survey.  

Using Survey logic; the Yelp API; and the Spoonacular API, we were able to find a cure to IDPS. Using our revolutionary survey, our app intuitively gauges the mood/vibe of any individual or group of people. Based on their answers, “What’s For Dinner” will not only decide their meal, but whether they should go out to dinner or stay in and cook something. Truly remarkable tech.  

Improvements:

Additional survey questions and results  
We could expand the number of foods we have, while also adjusting the answers (or creating more questions/answers) to help narrow down what the user is feeling the most.
